# JPACRUDProject

## Description

In this project I was able to create a website that is able to interact with a database. I created a database and populated it with information about various marine life. The website I created gives the user full control over the database. It allows for the user to create a new marine life object, edit existing ones, delete existing ones, and reads the information from the database and presents it to the user.

## Lessons Learned

Creating a CRUD project that uses JPA and spring helped me understand how different files and classes communicate with one another. I was able to learn how user input can be translated from HTML to Java and then from Java to a SQL database to retrieve information. I also learned a well design schema and entity mappings help simplify data retrieval and manipulation.
